Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath
Vital Signs: BP 140/90, HR 95, Temp 98.6°F
Lab Results: Troponin I elevated at 0.8 ng/mL (normal <0.04)
Imaging: CT scan shows 5mm nodule in right upper lobe
History: 20-pack-year smoking history, family history of CAD
Assessment needed: Rule out acute coronary syndrome"

AI ANALYSIS SIMULATION:
Based on the clinical presentation:
1. Elevated troponin suggests myocardial injury
2. Chest pain + SOB + risk factors indicate ACS workup needed  
3. Lung nodule requires follow-up imaging
4. Recommend: ECG, echo, cardiology consult
5. Smoking cessation counseling indicated

DISPOSITION: Admit for cardiac monitoring and further evaluation.
