üåê GNOS - GlobalNamespace OS

Everything is a file. Even your cloud. (Eventually)

‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Proof of Concept
GNOS is currently a demonstration of what's possible, not a working product. Most operations are simulated to show the potential of the concept.
üéØ The Vision
Imagine if all your cloud infrastructure worked like this:
bash# Deploy to cloud
cp api.py /mnt/gnos/cloud/aws/lambda/functions/

# Run AI inference
echo "Explain quantum computing" > /mnt/gnos/proc/llama3
cat /mnt/gnos/proc/llama3

# Call APIs
echo '{"message": "Hello"}' > /mnt/gnos/net/http/api.example.com/webhook
That's what we're building. A filesystem interface for all infrastructure.
üî® What Actually Works Right Now
‚úÖ Implemented

FUSE filesystem that mounts at /mnt/gnos
Basic directory structure (/proc, /cloud, /net, /dev)
Simulated AI responses when you write to /proc/llama3
Security framework with capability tokens (partially working)
Driver architecture ready for real implementations

‚ùå Not Yet Implemented (But Simulated)

Real AI model integration (returns fake responses)
Actual cloud storage operations (S3, GCS, etc.)
Real HTTP/API calls
Database operations
Any actual infrastructure integration

üìù What You Can Actually Do Today
bash# Mount GNOS
sudo ./target/release/gnos-mount mount -m /mnt/gnos -f

# Create a capability token
./target/release/gnos-mount token -p "/proc/llama3" -p "rw" -e 24

# Write to the simulated AI
echo "Hello AI" > /mnt/gnos/proc/llama3

# Read the simulated response
cat /mnt/gnos/proc/llama3
# Output: "GNOS AI Model: LLaMA3-7B (Simulated)..."

# That's about it for now! üòÖ
ü§î Why This Project Exists
Modern development requires juggling dozens of SDKs:
javascript// The pain is real
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';
// ... 20 more imports

// Different auth for each
const s3 = new AWS.S3({ credentials: {...} });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY });
// ... etc
GNOS proposes a radical simplification: What if everything was just file I/O?

cd gnos
cargo build --release

# Mount the filesystem
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/gnos
sudo ./target/release/gnos-mount mount -m /mnt/gnos -f

# In another terminal, explore
ls /mnt/gnos
echo "What is GNOS?" > /mnt/gnos/proc/llama3

üìä Honest Performance Numbers
What We ClaimReality"AI inference in 2.8s"Fake response in ~100ms"S3 upload at 120MB/s"Not implemented"10x faster development"Theoretical - needs real drivers
üõ†Ô∏è Want to Make This Real?
We need help implementing actual drivers:
Priority 1: Make ONE Thing Work
Instead of simulating everything, we should pick one integration and make it real:
rust// src/drivers/openai.rs - This doesn't exist yet!
impl GnosDriver for OpenAiDriver {
    async fn write(&self, path: &Path, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
        // Actually call OpenAI API
        let prompt = String::from_utf8(data.to_vec())?;
        let response = self.client.completions().create(prompt).await?;
        self.cache.insert(path, response);
        Ok(())
    }
}

‚ùì FAQ
Q: Is this production-ready?
A: No! This is a proof-of-concept. Most features are simulated.
Q: Why Rust?
A: FUSE requires low-level control, and Rust provides safety without sacrificing performance.
Q: Will this actually work for real infrastructure?
A: That's what we're trying to find out! The concept is sound, but implementation has challenges.
Q: What's the biggest challenge?
A: Mapping stateful operations (websockets, transactions) to a stateless file interface.
üéØ Next Steps

Implement ONE real driver (probably OpenAI or S3)
Measure actual performance with real API calls
Solve error handling through the filesystem
Build community around the concept
